In the previous view, you can tap the name of the maker to rename it.

Tap **Discard** to discard the marker and hotspots. The app asks you to confirm the action. Tap **Discard** to confirm, which discards the current marker and hotspots and returns you to the **Capture View**. Tap **Cancel** to dismiss the confirmation prompt.

Tap **Save** to save the marker to the cloud, add it to the resource list, and save a local copy. This also brings you back to the **Capture View** so you can capture another image.
